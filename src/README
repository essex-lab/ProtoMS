This directory contains all of the source code for ProtoMS 3.

Contents:

*.F            : Fortran 77 source files
*.inc          : Fortran include files - these declare all of the global variables
getid.py       : Python script used to identify the commit version of the source code.
                 This is not really useful to non-developers.

sfmakedepend   : Third-party script that calculates the dependancies of each Fortran
                 source file to each include file. This is only needed by developers, and
                 is run used via 'make depend'. This will modify the Makefile and leave
                 a backup in Makefile.old
