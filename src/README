This directory contains all of the source code for ProtoMS 2.

Contents:

*.F            : Fortran 77 source files
*.inc          : Fortran include files - these declare all of the global variables
*.o            : Fortran object files - these may be safely removed after a compilation
Makefile       : Makefile to compile ProtoMS 2
getid.py       : Python script used to identify the subversion version of the source code.
                 This is not really useful to non-developers, and its use can be stopped
                 by uncommenting the 'NOPYTHON2' line in the Makefile

sfmakedepend   : Third-party script that calculates the dependancies of each Fortran
                 source file to each include file. This is only needed by developers, and
                 is run used via 'make depend'. This will modify the Makefile and leave
                 a backup in Makefile.old
                 
TODO           : List of things that the developers plan to do for future releases. This
                 is a wishlist, so do not hold us to it!
                 
parsefortran.py  : Script used to generate the auto-docs part of the developer documentation.
                   This is not needed by normal users.
