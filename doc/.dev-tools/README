This text describes how to compile the developmental document for the python tools.

The document is compiled using Sphinx (www.sphinx-doc.org/). 
This tool reads in all the python modules in the tools directory and extracts the docstrings.
It is assumed that the docstrings are in the numpy format.

-------------
Pre-requisits
-------------

If python2.7 is not the default Python version, you need to install
it manually with python2.7

Sphinx:
git clone https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx.git
cd sphinx/
python2.7 setup.py install --user

numpydoc:
git clone https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc.git
cd numpydoc/
python2.7 setup.py install --user

(the latter one is an add-on to Sphinx to correctly parse the docstrings)

------------
Installation
-------------

These commands were executed to initiate this folder and the Spinx documentation. 
They don't have to be performed again.

sphinx-quickstart

Project name: ProtoMS
Author names: Richard Bradshaw, Ana Cabedo Martinez, Chris Cave-Ayland, Samuel Genheden, Gregory Ross
Version: 3.0
autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: y

Otherwise defaults


make html

insert
sys.path.insert(0,os.path.abspath('..'))
in conf.py

sphinx-apidoc -o . ../

Installed numpydoc
and added
'numpydoc' to extensions in conf.py

-----------
Compilation
-----------
make html

At the moment the Makefile assumes that sphinx is installed in ~/.local/bin/,
if that is not the case, please edit the make file.
