To compile ProtoMS go into the 'src' directory, 
edit the Makefile to suit your needs and the type 'make'

You will need a fortran compiler and the OpenMPI libraries. 
We recommend to use either GNU or Intel compilers.

We recommend to set the environmental variable $PROTOMSHOME to the installation directory of ProtoMS.

To learn how to use ProtoMS read the manual that can be found in the doc folder

There are some examples of using ProtoMS in the tutorial directory.
Use these examples to test that ProtoMS is working correctly.
