--------------------------------

To compile ProtoMS create a new directory 'build' and from this directory type 'cmake ..'. 

To compile ProtoMS with MPI type 'cmake -MPI=YES ..' from the 'build' directory.

This will perform checks and prepare to compile.  Then type 'make install'.

If you get 'permission denied' error when writing to folders, you may need to use 'sudo make install'.

Requirements:
* Fortan compiler                     : GNU (https://gcc.gnu.org/) or Intel recommended
* Python (https://www.python.org/)    : Required to compile and run ProtoMS
* CMake (http://www.cmake.org/)       : Required to compile ProtoMS

Optional:
* MPI                                 : Recommended OpenMPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/) or MPICH (https://www.mpich.org/) - some functions will be unavailable without MPI

We recommend to set the environmental variable $PROTOMSHOME to the installation directory of ProtoMS.

The ProtoMS tools has the following requirements:
* Python, version 2.7
* NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/)
* Matplotlib (http://www.matplotlib.org/)

Optional:
* AmberTools (http://www.ambermd.org/)          : Required to paramterise small molecules
* pymbar (https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar) : Required to perform MBAR calculations

To learn how to use ProtoMS read the manual that can be found in the doc folder

There are some examples of using ProtoMS in the tutorial directory.
Use these examples to test that ProtoMS is working correctly.
