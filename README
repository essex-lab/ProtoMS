--------------------------------

To compile ProtoMS create a new directory 'build' and from this directory type 'cmake ..'.
This will perform checks and prepare to compile.  Then type 'make'.

Requirements:
* Fortan compiler   : GNU or Intel recommended
* Python            : Required to compile and run ProtoMS
* CMake             : Required to compile ProtoMS

Optional:
* MPI               : Recommended OpenMPI or MPICH - some functions will be unavailable without MPI

We recommend to set the environmental variable $PROTOMSHOME to the installation directory of ProtoMS.

To learn how to use ProtoMS read the manual that can be found in the doc folder

There are some examples of using ProtoMS in the tutorial directory.
Use these examples to test that ProtoMS is working correctly.
