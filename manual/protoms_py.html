<code><h1>protoms.py</h1></code>
This program is used to setup a ProtoMS simulation. It was made with usability at highest priority. The only input that should be necessary is a couple of prepared PDB files containing the molecules one would like to simulate. 
<p></p>
<p>The program will create force field for small molecules, setup the protein and solvate the prepared system. At the moment it can setup the following types of simulations:
<ol>
	<li>Equilibration</li>
	<li>Sampling</li>
	<li>Dual-topology free energy</li>
	<li>Single-topology free energy</li>
	<li>Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)</li>
	<li>Just Add Waters, stage 1 and 2 (JAWS-1, JAWS-2)</li>
</ol> </p>
<p>The program will create files and inputs based on experience that should work in most situations. However there might be situations where the created settings are not appropriate. One can then use individual tools to make a more custom setup, see this <a href="tools_guide.html">page</a>. One might also have to edit the files manually.</p>

<b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
protoms.py
protoms.py.py -s sampling -l lig1.pdb --dovacuum --testrun
protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb lig2.pdb -p protein.pdb
protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb --absolute

</pre>
<p></p>

<b>Notes:</b>
<p></p>
<p>The program will try to locate previously created files for the protein and ligand in the current working directory or any folder specified with the <code>-f</code> flag. For ligands the program will replace <code>.pdb</code> with the appropriate ending, such as <code>.prepi</code> for Amber prepi files and <code>.tem</code> for ProtoMS template files.</p>
<p>Starting with just the PDB-files of the ligand(s) and the protein, the program will create the following files in the same folder as those PDB-files
<pre><ul>
<li>lig.prepi = the z-matrix and atom types of the ligand in Amber format
<li>lig.frcmod = additional parameters not in GAFF
<li>lig.zmat = the z-matrix of the ligand used to sample it in the MC simulation
<li>lig.tem = the complete template (force field) file for the ligand in ProtoMS format
<li>li1-li2.tem = the combined template file of all ligands 
    the filename is a combination of the residue name of all ligands   
<li>lig_box.pdb = the box of water solvating the ligand
<li>protein_scoop.pdb = the truncated protein structure
<li>protein_pms.pdb = the original protein structure with ProtoMS naming convention
    if the scoop removes to few residues, this file be created instead
<li>water.pdb = the cap of water solvating the protein system
</ul>
</pre>

In addition, for dual-topology simulations the following files are created:
<pre><ul>
<li>lig1_dummy.pdb = the dummy particle that the ligand will be perturbed to
    only created if the --absolute flag is set 
</ul></pre>
<br>

In addition, for single-topology simulations the following files are created:
<pre><ul>
<li>li1-li2_ele.tem = the ProtoMS template file for electrostatic single-topology perturbation 
<li>li1-li2_vdw.tem = the ProtoMS template file for van der Waals single-topology perturbation       
<li>settings.singlemap = the created correspondance map for single topology  
  only named like this if the --singlemap argument is not set  
</ul></pre>
<br>
In addition, for GCMC / JAWS-1 simulations the following files are created:
<pre><ul>
<li>gcmc_box.pdb / jaws1_box.pdb = the GCMC / JAWS-1 simulation box 
<li>gcmc_wat.pdb = the GCMC / JAWS-1 reservoire waters       
<li>water_clr.pdb = the cap of water solvating the protein system, cleared from the GCMC / JAWS-1 simulation box
</ul></pre>

In addition, for JAWS-2 simulations the following files are created:
<pre><ul>
<li>jaws2_watN.pdb = the JAWS-2 water
    each of the water given with the --gcmc_water flag will be written to an individual file 
<li>jaws2_notN.pdb = the rest of the JAWS-2 water
<li>water_clr.pdb = the cap of water solvating the protein system, cleared from the GCMC / JAWS-1 simulation box
</ul></pre>

</p>
<p>It will create at most two ProtoMS command files, one for the protein simulation and one for the ligand simulation. These can be used to run ProtoMS, e.g.
<pre>
$PROTOMS/protoms3 run_free.cmd</pre></p>
<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b>
<p></p>
The program assumes that both the ligand and the protein is prepared before. This includes for instance protonation. One can read more about setting up ligands and proteins here.
<p>The progam requires <a href="www.ambermd.org">AmberTools</a> to make force field for small molecules.</p>
