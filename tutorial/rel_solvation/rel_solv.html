<H1>Relative solvation free energy of ethane and methanol</H1>
<p>
This tutorial is an extension of the task <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/protomsworkshop/home/exercise-2---relative-hydration-free-energy" target="_blank">carried out</a> in the ProtoMS workshops, giving a flavour of the utilities of ProtoMS. 
Basic instructions for performing simulations are available in the workshop (and copied below) - here we will run longer simulations than we did in the workshop 
and focus more on the analysis of simulations.</p>

<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<ul>
	<li><code>ethane.pdb</code> - the structure of an ethane molecule in PDB format. It can be downloaded <a href="ethane.pdb" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li><code>methanol.pdb</code> - the structure of a methanol molecule in PDB format. It can be downloaded <a href="methanol.pdb" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
Both ethane and methanol should require almost no preparation for use with ProtoMS aside from ensuring they are sensible, energy minimised structures. 
However, for more complex molecules you may need to take additional care in preparation (e.g. choose protonation states or tautomers). You can read more about setting up structures <a href="../prep_struct.html">here</a>.

<h3>Simple setup &mdash; single topology simulation</h3>
<h5>Setup</h5>
<p>
We will start with a single topology approach. While conceptually this may be simpler, there are some careful choices that need to be made in setup, as you will see. The simplest way to start the setup of the simulation is by typing the following:</p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s singletopology -l ethane.pdb methanol.pdb </pre>
<p>
<i>How to choose corresponding atoms</i></p>
<p>
You'll notice that protoms.py asks us to define the corresponding atoms for the mutation of ethane to methanol. At this point it helps to visualise the perturbation taking place:
<pre>
                H02  H06              H02  H06
                 |    |                |    |
Ethane   :  H03-C01--C05-H07  ==> H03-C01--O05-DUM  : Methanol
&lambda;=0.0            |    |                |    |          &lambda;=1.0    
                H04  H08              H04  DUM  
</pre> 
Clearly there are some atoms that have obvious partners when making the transformation. C01, H02, H03 and H04 should remain with their same names. Likewise, C05 should be transformed to O05. Dummy atoms can be defined simply by pressing enter instead of typing in a corresponding atom name. 
However, which ethane atoms should we choose to be perturbed to dummy atoms in methanol? In theory it should make no difference - all three atoms of the methyl group are degenerate. In this case we will choose H06.</p>
<p>
<i>What difference does it make?</i></p>
<p>
When asking for corresponding atom definitions, protoms.py creates a distance matrix to help you in the decision making. You should see a table like this:
<pre>
These are the distances (A): 
             C05     H04     H06     H07     H08     H02     H03
     O05   0.116   2.036   1.135   1.138   1.132   2.060   2.101
     H06   0.930   2.195   1.688   1.681   0.199   2.398   2.867
     H04   2.137   0.000   2.566   3.045   2.355   1.779   1.760
     H03   2.204   1.760   2.465   2.659   3.065   1.749   0.000
     H02   2.162   1.779   3.051   2.434   2.570   0.000   1.749
</pre>
Note that the closest ethane atom to methanol H06 is actually H08, at a distance of 0.199 &Aring;. It would seem straightforward to choose this. <b>BUT</b>, 
although the three methyl hydrogens are chemically degenerate, we need to take their function in the model into account too...</p>
<p>
An important feature to sample in both the simulation of ethane and methanol is rotation around the central dihedral, H-C-C-H or H-C-O-H respectively. Remember that in ProtoMS (and many other software packages) the topology of a molecule is defined by a z-matrix. 
We therefore want to make sure that all four atoms involved in the central dihedral are <b>real</b> atoms at both &lambda;=0.0 and &lambda;=1.0. If any of the atoms are perturbed to a dummy, then the dihedral won't be sampled! 
(For obvious reasons - if we remove one of the atoms then the dihedral no longer exists!). Let's take a closer look at our template files to see if we need to be careful of this. Open up <code>ethane.tem</code>. You'll see a line that looks like this:</p>
<pre>dihedral  H06 ETH  C05 ETH  C01 ETH  H04 ETH flex 2.500</pre> 
<p>
So, the central dihedral in ethane is defined between the H06 and H04 atoms. This means that if we choose to perturb H06 to a dummy, this dihedral will no longer be sampled! You can check this if you like - 
run the protoms.py setup twice, once choosing H06<sub>(ethane)</sub> -> H06<sub>(methanol)</sub> and once choosing H08<sub>(ethane)</sub> -> H06<sub>(methanol)</sub>. If you open up the combined <code>ethtmeo_comb.tem</code> both times you'll see lines like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>H06 -> H06: <code>dihedral  H06 ETH  C05 ETH  C01 ETH  H04 ETH flex 2.500 param 1606 1176</code></li>
	<li>H08 -> H06: <code>#dihedral  H06 ETH  C05 ETH  C01 ETH  H04 ETH flex 2.500 param 0 0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
See how in the second case (in which H06 is perturbed to a dummy) the dihedral line is commented out and so not sampled at all. What would happen if we ran a simulation with this input? 
Take a look below - on the left we have the gas phase &lambda;=0.0 structures with 'correct' parameters, on the right the structures when H06 is perturbed to a dummy:</p>
<img src="" alt="Insert combined vmd overlays here" />
<p>
This should serve as a warning to check your inputs before running a simulation, or, even better, to set up short test simulations using the <code>--testrun</code> option of protoms.py to check your perturbations look correct before expending lots of CPU time.</p>
<p><i>Final setup</i></p>
<p>
After correctly defining corresponding atoms we should be ready to run a simulation. You should see files for a simulation of the free leg (in water) the gas phase leg of the relative free energy cycle.<p> The simulations will run 5 m equilibration steps and 40 m production steps for each of the 16 &lambda;-values. 
Output will be printed to files every 100 k moves and Hamiltonian replica-exchanges between neighbouring &lambda;-values will be attempted every 200 k moves. You can read more about the files that the setup script creates further down on this <a href="#files">page</a>.
Take a look at your created system (for example, <code>ethane.pdb</code> and <code>ethane_box.pdb</code>) in VMD. It should look like this:</p>
<img src="ethane_box.png" width="335" height="315" alt="Ethane in a water box" />
<h5>Execution</h5>
<p>
We have two choices for how to perform our perturbations. We can either change both the electrostatic and van der Waals parameters of our molecule simultaneously (i.e. a 'combined' perturbation), or separately (i.e. separate 'ele' and 'vdw' simulations). 
Here we'll try both and compare the results. To run the free and gas phase legs of the simulation with the combined perturbation protocol you need to execute:</p>
<pre>mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_comb_free.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_comb_gas.cmd
</pre>
<p>Otherwise to run the two legs using the separate perturbation protocol you need to execute:</p>
<pre>mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_ele_free.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_ele_gas.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_vdw_free.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_vdw_gas.cmd
</pre>
This is most conveniently done on a computer cluster. If you run all 6 calculations they will take approximately 6 h to complete.
<p>
<h5>Analysis</h5>
When the simulations are finished you need to analyse the simulation and extract the free energy of the bound and free legs. We will start with looking at some energy series to investigate whether the simulations are converged. Type
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_series.py -f out_free/lam-0.000/results
</pre>
to look at time series for the free leg at &lambda;=0.0. In the wizard that appears you can type <code>total</code> followed by enter. This will plot the total energy as a function of simulation snapshot. It should look something like this:<br> 
<img src="results_total_free.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="" /><br>
the program will also give you some indicating on the equilibration of this time series. In this case, you should see equilibration fairly early in the simulation. Thus, we have to discard very little of the simulation when we compute the free energy.
<p>Next, we will analyse how effective the &lambda; replica exchange was. Type</p>
<pre>
grep "lambda swaps" out_free/lam-0.000/info
</pre>
and this will give you the overall acceptance ratio of the &lambda; swaps. It should be around 50% for this perturbation, indicating that the overall effectiveness is acceptable. Next, we will look at individual replicas and see how they exchange &lambda;-value throughout the simulation. This can be done with
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_replicapath.py -f out_free/lam-*/results -p 0.0 0.2 0.8 1.0 -o replica_path_free.png
</pre>
<p>to plot the path of the first two &lambda;-values. It should look something like this.<br> <img src="replica_path_free.png" width="33%" height="33%" alt="" /><br> as is clear, these the replicas was not able to traverse the full &lambda;-space within the simulation time. Also the replica starting with &lambda;=1.0 or 0.0, did not exchange very much at all. Hence, the replica exchange was not fully efficient.</p>
<p>Now, we will estimate the free energy. We will do this both with thermodynamic integration, Bennet's acceptance ratio (BAR) and multi BAR (MBAR). To do this you can type</p>
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_dg.py -d out_free/ -s 10
</pre>
<p>A typical result is between 0 and 1 kcal/mol. Notice that only 10 snapshots are removed from the 400 snapshots when calculating the free energy, because the analysis with <code>calc_series.py</code> indicated that the simulation was equilibrated very much from the start.</p>
<p>It is important to study the gradient of the TI calculation. It should be smooth in order for the TI to work properly. For the free leg it should look something like this <br>
<img src="gradients.png" width="%" height="33%" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, we need to repeat the analysis for the bound leg. You will notice that the equilibration of this simulation is much worse. The computed free energy should be between 6.5 and 7.5 kcal/mol (depending on TI or BAR and equilibration removed). </p>This gives a relative binding free energy of about -0.5 kcal/mol. </p>
<p>

<h3>Single-topology simulation</h3>
The calculation above is dual-topology, which means that the two ligands are simulated simulatenously. There is an alternative methodology that is called single-topology where only a single ligand is simulated but the force field of this ligand is perturbed. This methodology has some advantages when the difference between the two ligand is small such as in our case. Therefore, we will also setup a single topology simulation.
<h5>Setup</h5>
In the single-topology simulation it is important to know which atoms on ligand 1 should be perturbed into which atoms on ligand 2. If the ligands differ in the number of atoms, as is typical, some atoms need to be perturbed into dummy atoms. Therefore, it is necessary that the larger ligand is perturbed into the small one. In our case, this means that we will perturb ligand 3 into ligand 1. If we look at the structures of the ligands, we see that the difference is in a methyl group; ligand 3 has an methyl group that is only a hydrogen atom in ligand 1. Therefore, we will perturb the methyl carbon to the hydrogen in ligand 1 and the hydrogens in the methyl group will be perturbed to dummy atoms. This is sketched below

To setup this simulation type:
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s singletopology -l lig3.pdb lig1.pdb -p protein.pdb</pre>
<p>
during the setup you will be prompted to type in the atoms in ligand 1 that corresponds to which atoms in ligand 3. For <code>C38</code> you should type <code>H38</code> and for the 3 methyl hydrogens <code>H43, H41, H42</code> you just leave blank to indicate that they should be perturbed to dummy atoms.
<p>
<p>
As with dual-topology, this sets up simulations for the bound leg and the free leg of the relative free energy cycle.<p> The simulations will run 5 m equilibration steps and 50 m production steps for each of the 16 &lambda;-values. Output will be printed to files every 100 k moves and Hamiltonian replica-exchanges between neighbouring &lambda;-values will be attempted every 200 k moves.  
</p>
<h5>Execution</h5>
The setup above will produce several ProtoMS command files. You have a choice to split up the perturbation in an electrostatic and van der Waals perturbation, or do the full perturbation in one step. The former can be advantageous if the perturbation is complicated. In addition to create input files for the bound and free leg, the setup will also setup command files for the perturbation in gas-phase. This calculation is of interest if you want to compute relative hydration free energy, or if you want to debug your perturbation. To run the one-step perturbations you need to execute
<p>
<pre>
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_comb_bnd.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_comb_free.cmd
mpirun -np 16 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_comb_gas.cmd
</pre>
<p>

This is most conveniently done on a computer cluster. The calculations will take approximately 48 h to complete.
<p></p>
<h5>Analysis</h5>
When the simulations are finished you need to analyse the simulation and extract the free energy of the bound and free legs. This procedure is the same as for the dual-topology simulation as above. If you decide to split up the perturbation, you need to do the analysis for both the electrostatic and van der Waals perturbation. For the gas-phase simulation, you can usually skip analysis the equilibration, as this leg equilibrates very quickly.

<hr align="center"/>
<p> 
<h3>Exploring more options</h3>
By running <code>protoms.py</code> as above, you accept the standard number of &lambda;-values, simulation length etcs. The values of these parameter were chosen from experience and should work for most systems. However, there are situations when you want to do something else. Here, we will go through some of the many available options. To know about other options you have to read the manuals for the tools or the MC program. You might also have to setup your system by executing the individual tools separately.
<p>
<h5>Running longer simulations</h5>
There are two arguments that you can invoke to run a longer simulation
<ul>
	<li><code>--nequil</code> - this controls the number of equilibration steps</li>
	<li><code>--nprod</code> - this controls the number of production steps</li>
</ul>  
by typing for instance
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb lig3.pdb -p protein.pdb --nequil 10E6 --nprod 50E6</pre>
<p>
you will run 10 m equiliration steps and 50 m production steps (instead of the 5 m and 40 m that is default)
<p>
<h5>Running with more &lambda;-values</h5>
The argument that controls the number of &lambda;-values is called <code>--lambdas</code>.
<p>
by typing for instance
<p>
<pre>python2.7  $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb lig3.pdb -p protein.pdb --lambdas 24</pre>
<p> 
you will initiate 24 &lambda;-values rather than default 16. You can also give individual &lambda;-values to the argument. For instance
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb lig3.pdb -p protein.pdb --lambdas 0.000 0.033 0.067 0.133 0.200 0.267 0.333 0.400 0.467 0.533 0.600 0.667 0.733 0.800 0.867 0.933 0.967 1.000</pre>
<p> 
will add two new &lambda;-values at 0.033 and 0.967 to the 16 created by default.
<p>
<h5>Running independent repeats</h5>
Usually it is wise to run several indepent repeats of your calculation to check for convergence and to obtain a good estimate of the statistical uncertainty. The argument that controls the number of independent repeats is called <code>--repeats</code> or just <code>-r</code>.
<p>
by typing for instance
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s dualtopology -l lig1.pdb lig3.pdb -p protein.pdb -r 5</pre>
you will create 5 input files for the bound leg and 5 input files for the free leg. Therefore, you also need to execute ProtoMS 10 times with the different input files. The output will be in 10 different folders, e.g. <code>out1_bnd</code> and <code>out2_bnd</code>.

<p>  
<pre>

<br>
this section, which exists in all input file setup the &lambda;-replica exchange. You can add more &lambda;-values manually if there are regions where the simulation is not performing well.
<p>
<br>
In the command files for dual-topology simulations, the following lines exist<br>
<p></p>
<pre>
dualtopology1 1 2 synctrans syncrot

</pre>
this section, which exist in both input files setup the dual topology simulation with appropriate soft-core parameters. It could be worth trying to optimize the soft-core parameters if your simulation is not performing well.

<p> 
<h3><a name="tools">Setting up the simulation with individual tools</a></h3>
In this advanced section we will go through the setup of the simulations step-by-step using individual setup scripts rather than <code>protoms.py</code>
<h5>Setting up the free leg</h5>
We will start setting up the free-leg simulation. However, it should be noted that some of the files created in this section will also be used in the bound-leg simulation.
<p></p>
<li>First we need to make sure that the very first line of lig1.pdb contains a directive, telling ProtoMS the name of the solute. The line should read <code>HEADER LI1</code> and can be added by typing
<pre>
sed -i "1iHEADER LI1" lig1.pdb
</pre>
<li>Thereafter, we will create the force field for the ligand using AmberTools. The force field will be GAFF with AM1-BCC charges. Type
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/ambertools.py -f lig1.pdb -n LI1</pre>
and this will execute the AmberTools programs <code>antechamber</code> and <code>parmchck</code>, creating the files <code>lig1.prepi</code> and <code>lig1.frcmod</code>, respectively.<p></p>
<li>These files are in Amber format and in order to use them in ProtoMS we need to reformat them into a ProtoMS template file. This file will also contain a z-matrix that describes how the ligand will be sampled during the simulation. To do this, you can type
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/build_template.py -p lig1.prepi -f lig1.frcmod -o lig1.tem -n LI1
</pre>
this will creates the files lig1.tem containing the ProtoMS template file and lig1.zmat. It is a good idea to check this files to see if the script has defined the molecule properly. 
<p></p>
<li>The steps above now need to be repeated for ligand 3.
<p>
</p>
<li>Now we should have all the force field files for the two ligands. The next step is to solvate them. Start with concatenating the two PDB files
<pre>
cat lig1.pdb lig3.pdb > temp.pdb
</pre>
and then we will create a water box of TIP4P water molecules around this pdb file. Type
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/solvate.py -b $PROTOMSHOME/data/wbox_tip4p.pdb -s temp.pdb -o lig1_box.pdb
</pre>
this will solvate both ligands using standard settings, i.e. it will be 10 A between the solute and the edge of the box. A pre-equilibrated box of TIP4P water molecules located in <code>$PROTOMSHOME/data/</code> is used. The box is written to the file lig1_box.pdb. 
<p></p>
<li>The next step differ if we want to setup a dual-topology or single-topology simulation, we will start with the dual-topology setup.
<p>We need to combine the template files for the two ligands using</p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/merge_templates.py -f lig1.tem lig3.tem -o li1-li3.tem</pre>
<p>creating li1-li3.tem.</p>
<p>For single-topology, we need to create template files for the electrostatic and van der Waals perturbation. This is done by</p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/make_single.py -t0 lig3.tem -t1 lig1.tem -p0 lig3.pdb -p1 lig1.pdb -o li3tli1</pre>
<p>Just as when using <code>protoms.py</code> you will be prompted to type in the corresponding atoms in the two molecules. This tool will create <code>li3-li1_ele.tem</code>, <code>li3-li1_vdw.tem</code>, <code>li3-li1_comb.tem</code>, and <code>li3-li1_cmap.dat</code> </p>
<p>Now we have all the files to run the free-leg of the simulation. The input file for ProtoMS will be created when we have prepared to bound-leg. </p>
<h5>Setting up the bound leg</h5>
<li>First, we will change the name of atom and residue names in the protein PDB-file such that they agree with the ProtoMS naming convention. Type
<p> 
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/convertatomnames.py -p protein.pdb -o protein_pms.pdb -s amber -c $PROTOMSHOME/data/atomnamesmap.dat</pre>
<p> 
The converted structure will be in <code>protein_pms.pdb</code>. This execution assumes that the Amber naming convention is used in <code>protein.pdb</code>. 
<p> 
<li>We have crystallographic water in the protein structure and we need to convert them to the water model we will be using in the simulation (TIP4P). This can be done by 
<p> 
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/convertwater.py -p protein_pms.pdb -o protein_pms_t4p.pdb</pre>
<p>
creating <code>protein_pms_t4p.pdb</code>. 
<p>
<li>Next step is to truncate to protein, creating a scoop. This will enable us to solvate the protein is a droplet and thereby reducing the number of simulated particles. The command is
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/scoop.py -p protein_pms_t4p.pdb -l temp.pdb -o protein_scoop.pdb</pre> 
<p> 
The protein scoop is centred on the two ligand molecule and all residue further than 20 A are cut-away. The scoop is written to <code>protein_scoop.pdb</code>
<p>
<li>As a final step, we will solvate the protein and ligand in a droplet of TIP4P water molecules. To this, type:
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/solvate.py -b $PROTOMSHOME/data/wbox_tip4p.pdb -s temp.pdb -pr protein_scoop.pdb -o water.pdb -g droplet</pre> 
this will create a droplet with 30 A radius centred on the benzene molecule. The droplet is written to <code>water.pdb</code>
<p> 
<li> The <code>solvate.py</code> script adds the crystallographic waters from the scoop to the droplet. Therefore, we need to remove them from the scoop PDB-file.<p> 
<pre>sed -i -e "/T4P/d" -e "/TER/d" protein_scoop.pdb</pre>
<p>
Now we have all the files need to run the simulation. As you noticed, this step-by-step procedure create a few files that <code>protoms.py</code> does not generate.
<h5>Making ProtoMS input files</h5>
To make the dual-topology input files for ProtoMS type
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/generate_input.py -s dualtopology -p protein_scoop.pdb -l lig1.pdb lig3.pdb -t li1-li3.tem -pw water.pdb -lw lig1_box.pdb -o run
</pre>
<p>creating <code>run_bnd.cmd</code> and <code>run_free.cmd</code></p>
and for single-topology input files type
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/generate_input.py -s singletopology -p protein_scoop.pdb -l lig3.pdb -t li3tli1_ele.tem -pw water.pdb -lw lig1_box.pdb -o run_ele --outfolder out_ele
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/generate_input.py -s singletopology -p protein_scoop.pdb -l lig3.pdb -t li3tli1_vdw.tem -pw water.pdb -lw lig1_box.pdb -o run_vdw --outfolder out_vdw
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/generate_input.py -s singletopology -p protein_scoop.pdb -l lig3.pdb -t li3tli1_comb.tem -pw water.pdb -lw lig1_box.pdb -o run_comb --outfolder out_comb
</pre>
<p>creating <code>run_ele_bnd.cmd</code>, <code>run_ele_free.cmd</code>, <code>run_ele_gas.cmd</code>, <code>run_vdw_bnd.cmd</code>, <code>run_vdw_free.cmd</code>, <code>run_vdw_gas.cmd</code>, <code>run_comb_bnd.cmd</code>, <code>run_comb_free.cmd</code> and <code>run_comb_gas.cmd</code> </p>
