<H1>Sampling and equilibration with MUP-I</H1>
Sampling the atomistic configurations of biomolecules is what ProtoMS is all about, and represents its most basic functionality. This tutorial will show you how to use Monte Carlo to generate configurations of major urinary protein 1 (MUP-I) complexed with a small molecule (PRZ). In addition, you will learn the importance of equilibration, and how we detect and deal with equilibration in ProtoMS.
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<ul>
	<li><code>prz.pdb</code> - the PDB structure of the small molecule PRZ</li>
	<li><code>protein.pdb</code> - the PDB structure of the MUP-I</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the protein and ligand have been protonated, and the protein atoms are in the AMBER naming scheme. The ligand is in its crystallographic pose. There is one cysteine bridge between residues 64 and 157, which have been labelled as CYX.  You can read more about setting up structures <a href="../prep_struct.html">here</a>.

<h3>Simple setup</h3>
<h5>Setup</h5>
All we need to do to set-up a simulation is type
<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s sampling -p protein.pdb -l prz.pdb</pre>
<p>
which automatically solvated the system, and using GAFF, generated the forcefield and topolographic information of the ligand. By entering <code>-s sampling </code>, we are telling <code> protoms.py </code> that we wish to sample configurations of the system. 

<p> 
The solvated system should look like this: <br>
<img src="system.png" width="%" height="40%" alt="" /><br>
</p>

<p>
The command file <code> run_bnd.cmd </code> was also generated by <code>protoms.py</code>; it summarises everything ProtoMS needs to know about running a simulation. At the bottom of <code> run_bnd.cmd </code> is

<pre>dump 100000 results write results
dump 100000 pdb all solvent=all file=all.pdb standard
dump 100000 restart write restart
dump 100000 averages reset
chunk equilibrate 5000000 solvent=784 protein=215 solute=1 volume=0
chunk simulate 40000000 solvent=784 protein=215 solute=1 volume=0</pre>
<p>

The lines starting with <code>chunk</code> tells ProtoMS what it should be sampling, and whether it should be recording data. The <code>chunk equilibrate 5000000</code> means that while 5,000,000 sequential system configurations will be generated, data will <b>not</b> be recorded over this period. Following that, <code>chunk simulate 40000000</code> means that 40,000,000 snap-shots will be generated, and that data <b>will</b> be recorded. This is the only difference between the <code>equilibrate</code> and <code>simulate</code> commands; they both sample the system, but only one can output data. The benefit of using <code>equilibrate</code> is that while the system is relaxing, the data is discarded without taking up any disk space. As <code>chunk simulate</code> comes after <code>chunk equilibrate</code>, the last frame from the equilibration run will be used as the start of the "simulate" <code>chunk</code>.
<p>

The lines starting with <code>dump</code> relate to <code>chunk simulate</code>, as they tell ProtoMS the frequency with which it will output the various files while it is simulating; these are the PDBs of the structures, the restart files, as well as the frequency with which cumlative averages (such as the total energy) will be reset.
<p>

As mentioned, there is one cysteine bridge in MUP-I. This needs to be constrained in ProtoMS as they are not yet properly coded for in ProtoMS. At the top of the <code>chunk</code> list, add

<pre>chunk fixresidues 1 64 157
chunk fixbackbone 1 63 65 156
</pre>

which will also constrain the residues immediately adjacent to the cysteine bridge. 
</p>
<p> 
<h5>Execution</h5>
Simply type
<pre>
$PROTOMSHOME/protoms3 run_bnd.cmd
</pre>
to simulate the system. This will use one processor and take at least 5 hours to complete.

<p>
<h5>Analysis</h5>
Because of some the time scales involved, this section will analyse a simulation that was twice as long as the one specified in the automatically generated <code>run_bnd.cmd</code>. This was done by changing <code>chunk simulate 40000000</code> to <code>chunk simulate 80000000</code> in <code>run_bnd.cmd</code>.

<p>
To view a movie of the simulation, you can use VMD:

<pre>vmd all.pdb</pre>

All there is to see is a lot of atoms wiggling and jiggling. What we're really interested in is how the energies of the system change as the simulation progresses. For instance, type

<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_series.py -f results -s total inter/protein1-solvent/sum inter/solvent-solvent/sum inter/prz-solvent/sum -p sub </pre>

which, due to the <code>-s</code> flag, will analyse the total energy (<code>total</code>), solvent-solvent interaction energy (<code>inter/solvent-solvent/sum</code>), protein-solvent interaction energy (<code>inter/protein1-solvent/sum</code>), and the ligand-solvent interaction energy (<code>inter/prz-solvent/sum</code>). The <code>-p sub</code> flag indicates we'd like the plots of energies printed as sub-plots, which, for our 80M move simulation look like <br>
<img src="Series1.png" width="%" height="80%" alt="" /><br>

As indicated by the y-axis, the total energy is shown in blue at the top left plot. The intriguing feature of the total energy is that over the course of the simulation, it decreases to what appears to be a constant average value. However, by eye, the total energy only appears to be roughly flat at around the 700th snapshot. As frames were output every 100,000 frames (as specified by the <code>dump</code> commands in <code>run_bnd</code>), 700 snapshots correspond to 70M Monte Carlo moves. 
<p>
What about equilibration? A necessary, but often insufficient, condition for equilibrium is
<p>
<blockquote> <i>"A quantity is said to be at equilibrium if it does not change with time." </i></blockquote> 
<p>

Therefore, it appears as if the system composed of water, MUP-I and the ligand PRZ does not reach equilibrium until around 70M moves. Will this energy drift affect free energy calculations? Some insight can be gained by looking at the plots of the other energies we produced, namely the protein-solvent interaction energy (yellow, bottom left). This quantity accounts for much for the decrease in the total energy. The solvent-solvent energy also appears, by eye, to also decrease with time. In contrast, the ligand-solvent energy appears roughly constant over the entirety of the simulation. Before reaching any conclusions about the equilibration of the ligand, let's have a look at the ligand-protein interaction energy. So that you can gain some experience with the interactive mode of <code>calc_series</code>, type

<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_series.py -f results</pre>

and, type <code>inter/protein1-prz1/sum</code> and hit the enter key. (Note that you can analyse the Lennard-Jones (<code>lj</code>) and Coulomb (<code>cou</code>) energies separately.) This will produce the ligand-protein interaction energy. In our simulation, we find <br>
<img src="Series2.png" width="%" height="50%" alt="" /><br>
<p>
Like the ligand-solvent energy, this quantity appears to vary around a constant value. 

<p>
We can also have a look at internal energies of the protein and ligand

<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/calc_series.py -f results -s intra/protein1/sum intra/prz/sum -p sub </pre>

<br><img src="Series3.png" width="%" height="50%" alt="" /><br>

These quantities also don't vary much over the course of the simulation. While the total energy &#8210; due to protein-solvent energy &#8210; does not reach equilibrium for the majority of the simulation, the energies associated with the ligand seem roughly constant. Therefore, if we were to use this data for free energy calculation on the ligand, the lack of drift in these energies would help us trust the numeric answers we get.
<p>
The keen eyed among you would have noticed that one every plot is a verticle dashed line, and every time <code>calc_series</code> is called produces output like

<pre>
Equilibration found at snapshot 543 for prz_sum, value=74.653
	This production part is estimated to contain 20 uncorrelated samples (g=12.472)
	The number of samples is maximized at 485, g=13.850 and the number of uncorrelated samples is 22
</pre>

This occurs because calc_series is automatically trying to find when a quantity reaches equilibrium. The dashed verticle line and first line of the output are done via a hypothesis test on whether the line is "flat" or not. Data to the left of the dashed line is estimated to be "unequilibrated", and data to the right is estimated to be "equilibrated". By trying to maximise the number of uncorrelated samples, a second estimate of the equilibration point is also produced. While these tools were designed to determine the points of equilibria objectively, they sometimes disagree with human intuition. Have another look at the plots above and see if you agree with the algorithm as to where to equilibration point is.

<h3><a name="files">Files created by the setup script</a></h3>
<h5>Simulation specific files</h5>
Running <code>make_gcmcbox.py</code> and <code>protoms.py</code> created the following files:
<ul>
	<li><code>water.pdb</code> = the droplet of solvent water that surrounds the protein and ligand</li>
	<li><code>protein_pms.pdb</code> = the PDB structure of the protein in the ProtoMS naming scheme</li>
	<li><code>prz.tem</code> = the forcefield template file of the ligand PRZ, which contains move information</li>
	<li><code>run_bnd.cmd</code> = the command file that tells ProtoMS what to simulate and how</li>
</ul>

The following files are also created, although they will not be needed for the equilibration of the protein-ligand-water system:

<ul>
	<li><code>prx_box.pdb</code> = cubic box of water around the ligand</li>
	<li><code>prz.zmat</code> = the z-matrix of the ligand, used to generate the ligand moves in Monte Carlo</li>
	<li><code>prz.prepi</code> = the AMBER prepi file of the ligand created by antechamber</li>
	<li><code>prz.frcmod</code> = the AMBER frcmod file that is also created by antechamber</li>
</ul>

The file <code>prz.tem</code> tells ProtoMS the partial charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for each atom in the ligand. It incorporates all the information present in <code>prz.zmat</code>, <code>prz.prepi</code> and <code>prz.frcmod</code>.

<p>
<hr align="center"/>
<p> 
<h3><a name="tools">Advanced set-up with individual tools</a></h3>
We can be extra careful in the way we set up our system when we use the tools located in the directory <code>$PROTOMSHOME/tools</code>. Here, we will set our simulation up from scratch.


<h5>Solvating the system</h5>

To solvate the protein with a sphere of water, enter

<p>
<pre>python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/solvate.py -pr protein.pdb -g droplet -b $PROTOMSHOME/data/wbox_tip4p.pdb -o water.pdb</pre>
<p>
to make the sphere of solvent in <code>water.pdb</code>. The default radius of the sphere is 30 &#8491;, which is fine in this case. A different radius can be specified by the <code>-r</code> flag.
<p>
It is important to consider that <code>solvate.py</code>, which is also called by <code>protoms.py</code>, adds water molecules randomly to the system based on a pre-equilibrated box of water. Water molecules that have been added but sterically clash with the protein or ligand are automatically removed. While this works okay in most situations, MUP-I has a very hydrophobic cavity, meaning that one should think very carefully about if and where one should add waters. With MUP-I, it is prudent to remove all the waters that have been added by <code>solvate.py</code> that are in the binding site. To do so, we will start by creating a box around the ligand that is at least 3 &#8491; away from it

<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/make_gcmcbox.py -s prz.pdb -p 3 -o box.pdb
</pre>
creating <code>box.pdb</code>, which can be visualsed in a molecular viewer, such as VMD. Any water molecules in <code>water.pdb</code> that are inside <code>box.pdb</code> can be removed 

<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/clear_gcmcbox.py -b box.pdb -s water.pdb -o water_clr.pdb
</pre>

creating <code>water_clr.pdb</code>.
<p>
To set-up the ligand from scratch, we use the GAFF forcefield and AMBERTOOLS. These are called via

<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/ambertools.py -f prz.pdb -c 0
</pre>

where <code>-c 0</code> tells AMBERTOOLS that PRZ has no net charge. This has created <code>prz.prepi</code> and <code>prz.frcmod</code>. To use these to generate the template file for ProtoMS, type

<pre>
python2.7  $PROTOMSHOME/tools/build_template.py -n prz -p prz.prepi -f prz.frcmod -o prz.tem
</pre>
which creates <code>prz.tem</code>.
<p>
Before proceeding, the protein atom names have to be adapted to the ProtoMS convention. This is done with the command
<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/convertatomnames.py -p protein.pdb -c $PROTOMSHOME/data/atomnamesmap.dat
</pre>
The files above need to be reference by the ProtoMS command file, created using

<pre>
python2.7 $PROTOMSHOME/tools/generate_input.py -p protein_pms.pdb -l prz.pdb -t prz.tem -pw water_clr.pdb -s sampling -o run_bnd.cmd --outfolder out_bnd --nprod 80000000 --nequil 5000000 
</pre>

creating <code>run_bnd.cmd</code>. Note that here we specify how long we want our equilibration and simulation time to be. If you recall, the data from the equilibration moves are not recorded. In the above, we specified that we want 5M moves of equilibration, and 80M moves for the production step. Given that it took roughly 70M moves for the total energy to equilibrate, if that were our quantity of interest, a much longer equilibration run would be necessary.

<p>
Finally, becuase there is a cysteine bridge in MUP-I, we need to add

<pre>
chunk fixresidues 1 64 157
chunk fixbackbone 1 63 65 156
</pre>

to the top of the <code>chunk</code> commands in <code>run_bnd.cmd</code>.

creating <code>run_bnd.cmd</code>.
